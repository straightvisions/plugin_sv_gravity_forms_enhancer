Improves Gravity Forms in various ways.

= Plugin Description =

SV Gravity Forms Enhancer brings several improvements for your Gravity Forms installation. While Gravity Forms is an easy to use feature rich form plugin, we see some technical limitations under the hood. This plugin improves some details which could become critical to your project, e.g. reaching Pagespeed 100 or allow multiple instances on a single page.

See <a href="https://straightvisions.com/sv-gravity-forms-enhancer/">SV Gravity Forms Enhancer Plugin Description</a> for details about all features.

== Roadmap ==

We will always look for ways on how to improve great plugins and features or build new ones where there is a demand.
